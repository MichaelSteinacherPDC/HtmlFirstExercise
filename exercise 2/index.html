<p> <i> <strong>Plot </strong></i>
    <br>
    In 1997, Elvis Presley's former manager, Colonel Tom Parker, is on his deathbed having suffered a stroke. Nursing a gambling addiction that has left him destitute, he looks back on how he first met the future King of Rock and Roll.
    
    Raised mostly by his doting mother Gladys, Elvis spent his childhood in the poorest parts of Mississippi. He finds an escape in the comic book adventures of Captain Marvel Jr. and especially in song, though once he moves with his parents to Memphis, he is ridiculed by his peers due to his fascination with the African-American music of Memphis' Beale Street. At this time, Parker is a carnival "huckster" who fancies himself a modern-day P.T. Barnum. Although Parker is partnered with country singer Hank Snow, Parker immediately realizes Elvis' crossover potential when he hears the white artist "sounding black" on the groundbreaking single, "That's All Right". That night, he sees Elvis at a Louisiana Hayride performance.
