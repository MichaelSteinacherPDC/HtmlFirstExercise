        <h1>Billy Joel - Movin' Out</h1>
        Anthony works in the grocery store<br>
        Savin' his pennies for someday<br>
        Mama Leone left a note on the door<br>
        She said, "Sonny, move out to the country"<br>
        Workin' too hard can give you<br>
        A heart attack (ack, ack, ack, ack, ack)<br>
        You oughta know by now (oughta know)<br>
        Who needs a house out in Hackensack<br>
        Is that what you get for your money?<br><br>
        It seems such a waste of time<br>
        If that's what it's all about<br>
        Mama if that's movin' up<br>
        Then <b> I'm movin' out</b><br>
        <b>I'm movin' out</b><br>
        Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat<br>
        At night he becomes a bartender<br>
        He works at Mister Cacciatore's down<br>
        On Sullivan Street<br>
        Across from the medical center<br>
        He's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac <i>(ack, ack, ack, ack, ack)</i><br>
        You oughta know by now<br>
        And if he can't drive<br>
        With a broken back<br>
        At least he can polish the fenders<br><br>
        It seems such a waste of time<br>
        If that's what it's all about<br>
        Mama if that's movin' up<br>
        Then <b>I'm movin' out</b><br>
        <b>I'm movin' out</b><br><br>
        You should never argue with a crazy mind <i>(mi-, mi-, mi-, mi-, mi-)</i><br>
        You oughta know by now<br>
        You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime<br>
        Is that all you get for your money<br>
        If that's what you have in mind<br>
        If that's what you're all about<br>
        Good luck movin' up<br>
        'Cause I'm moving out<br>
        I'm moving out (mmm)<br>
        Ou, ou, uh huh (mmm)<br>
        I'm moving out<br>
